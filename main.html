    <h1>Understanding Time, Space, and Complexity</h1>
    <p>In computer science, time complexity refers to the amount of time taken by an algorithm to complete its execution as a function of the length of the input. It is a measure of the efficiency of an algorithm concerning the amount of time it takes to run, often denoted using Big O notation.</p>
    <p>Space complexity, on the other hand, measures the amount of memory space required by an algorithm to solve a problem as a function of the size of the input. It is often denoted using Big O notation as well. For example, an algorithm with space complexity O(n) means that the amount of memory required increases linearly with the size of the input.</p>
    <p>In summary, while time complexity focuses on the efficiency of an algorithm in terms of time, space complexity focuses on its efficiency in terms of memory usage. Both are crucial considerations when designing and analyzing algorithms for various applications.</p>
