    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>
    <p>Time complexity is undersatnd as the time taken by a program to run and compleate the given task. As a programmer, your goal should to reduce the time complexity of the code by optimizzng it and make it more efficient    </p>
    <p><b>Space Complexity</b>is a related to the memory occupied by the program. For Example,if a progarm takes an array of size n as input, the space complexity of the program becomes O(n) </p>
